# MarketingAnalytics---SQL-PBI
The repository contains all files from scratch to the end of the project.

DATABASE used for this project was PortfolioProject_MarketingAnalytics.
The company sent an imaginary business request for us to explore and solve.
The business demand overview and user stories were created from the business request, so the project could be done accordingly.
After analysis, the tables were properly cleansed from "errors" and we extracted only necessary data.
Results of cleansed tables from SQL where imported to Microsoft Power BI for DAX  calculations and Dashboard - Visualization purposes.
As the last step of the project, Microsoft Power BI dashboards that contain everything that company wanted have been created: Overview, Conversion Details, and Social Media Details
